copy PARALLEL_BASE_SONG_MAIN

copy PARALLEL_BASE_SONG_AUX   (max 3 for 4 cpus)

In AUX link ( ln -s ) from MAIN :
      z03.ck   (SYNC script, mandatory)
      config.ck

In MAIN update parallel_launch.sh with all AUX.

Every songs MAIN and AUX must have the file aux_song_dont_reset_launchpad, EXCEPT the first one called in  parallel_launch.sh. This is to reset the launchpad.

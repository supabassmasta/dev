"band compressor, 3 band stereo width control, lookahead limiter, boost, and "
"a number of other features.\n"

"    The hand drawn EQ (HDEQ) allows the user to draw the EQ curve using the "
"mouse.  The curve is then splined to fill 1024 EQ bands.  There are a number "
"of other options available in the HDEQ.  There are user defined notches that "
"act as a parametric EQ.  There are also crossover controls that will allow "
"the user to change the compressor crossover points.  The following is a "
"quick guide to using the HDEQ:\n"
"\n"
"    In the background window - left click and release to begin drawing the "
"curve.  Left click again to end the curve.  You can define any portion of "
"the curve, you don't have to define the entire curve.  Drawing can be done "
"from left to right or right to left.  If you try to reverse direction while "
"drawing the data in the reverse direction will be ignored.  You can discard "
"the curve that you are drawing by clicking the middle or right buttons.  "
"Clicking the right mouse button in the HDEQ when not drawing a curve will "
"reset all EQ and notch values to their original (flat) settings.\n"

"If you hold the shift key while adjusting the notch handle it will only move "
"in the Y (gain) direction.\n"

"compressor works for 25-500Hz, the second for 500Hz-5KHz, and the last for "

"Fugue - verse).  You can recall these settings by left clicking on the scene "
"button.  A bright green button means that the scene associated with this "

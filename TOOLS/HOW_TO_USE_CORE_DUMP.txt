Set ulimit to unlimited, to allow system to generate the core in the current directory:
ulimit -c unlimited

Check ulimit value with
ulimit -c
ulimit -a

To use the core file :

gdb program_who_crash -c core

or 

ddd  program_who_crash -c core


It is of course better to compile with -g option to have debub symbols

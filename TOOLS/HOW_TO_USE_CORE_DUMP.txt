Set ulimit to unlimited, to allow system to generate the core in the current directory:
ulimit -c unlimited

Check ulimit value with
ulimit -c
ulimit -a

To use the core file :

gdb program_who_crash -c core

or 

ddd  program_who_crash -c core


It is of course better to compile with -g option to have debub symbols



If source files are missing:
--------------------------
in ddd use command: dir path_to_add
be careful of '..' in relative path known by ddd.

To find source in linux:
install package source in package manager. Look at its properties in packet manager to find where are sources.
for glibc (pthread nptl etc...) it is /usr/src/glibc, in the tar file.

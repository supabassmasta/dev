Method tested on oai2 remote host.
It is almost live caputre, as you have to reload the log in wireshark to display new message.
It should be possible to do full live remote logging with sshdump interface in wireshark. But can't get it to work now.

On remote host:
Allow tcpdump to access network interface withoout sudo:

sudo setcap  cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/bin/tcpdump
You can verify capabilities with:
getcap /usr/bin/tcpdump

On local hosti Terminal 1:
ssh jsm@oai2 "tcpdump -U -i br-d7464ce119cd -w -" > CAPTURE_FILE

Terminal 2:
wireshark CAPTURE_FILE

Note: use relaod button to update capture

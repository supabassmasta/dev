Enable devlopper menu:
Parameters> About phone > Tap 7 times on Build number

Go to developper option and activate:
USB debbuging
unlock OEM bootloader

If unlock OEM bootloader option is not present: update the phone software (it was enough for me).
    There is tricks with disabling automatic clock update to disable and setup a older date (2022) but I dont tried it.

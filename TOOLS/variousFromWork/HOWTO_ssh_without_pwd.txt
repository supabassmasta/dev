here we want to ssh connect to a sever without password
Warning this method is not persistent after reboot. on the client ssh-add key_pair_name must be done again. ssh-add command can be added in .bashrc to automate the process


1) Generate ssh keys pair on the client
cd .ssh
ssh-keygen
# Enter the name of the key pair, On pwd request type ENTER twice if you don't want password

2) Check ssh-agent is running
pgrep ssh-agent

3) Register the private key on the client
ssh-add key_pair_name

4) Copy the public key to the server
ssh-copy-id -i key_pair_name.pub user@host
# Enter user password

5) You can now connect withour password
ssh user@host
